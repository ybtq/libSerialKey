# libSerialKey

A simple serial number library. I recommend using static library if you want to use it in you client program, because the shared library is easy to crack.

## Build

### windows
* libSerialKey.vcxproj: build static library
* libSerialKey_dll.vcxproj: build shared library

### Linux

build with Makefile
